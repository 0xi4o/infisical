3. On the application overview screen, select **Single sign-on** from the left sidebar. From there,
   select the **SAML** single sign-on method.

4. Next, press the **Edit** button in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section and configure the following fields:

- Identifier (Entity ID): https://app.infisical.com
- Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL): `https://app.infisical.com/api/v1/sso/saml2/:identifier`

<Note>
  If you're self-hosting Infisical, then you will want to replace
  `https://app.infisical.com` with your own domain.
</Note>

5. Next, press the **Edit** button in the **Attributes & Claims** section.

In the **Attributes && Claims** section, configure the following claims to map:

- `email -> user.userprinciplename`
- `firstName -> user.firstName`
- `lastName -> user.lastName`

Once you've done that, head back to the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** screen.

6. Get IdP values:

Back in Infisical > Organization settings > Authentication, select **Set up SAML SSO** and paste your Infisical SAML SSO configuration details
with the following map from the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** screen in Azure:

- `Audience -> Azure `
- `Entrypoint -> X`
- `Issuer -> X`
- `Certificate -> X.509 Certificate from Azure`

7. Assignments

Finally, navigate to the **Users and groups** tab and select the + button to assign access to the login with SSO application on a user or group-level.

8. Return to Infisical and enable SAML SSO.

Enabling SAML SSO enforces all members in your organization to only be able to log into Infisical via Azure.
