A project houses application configuration and secrets for an application.

## Secrets Overview

The **Secrets Overview** page captures a birds-eye-view of secrets and folders across environments like development, staging, or production. 
This is useful for comparing secrets, identifying if anything is missing, and making quick changes.

## Secrets Dashboard

The **Secrets Dashboard** page appears when you press to manage the secrets of a particular environment.

### Secrets

Secrets can be added to or removed from a project. By default, they are pre-populated in your first project for demonstration. 
For any subsequent project, if applicable, it can be convenient to add items by dragging and dropping a .env file containing them.

Here's what dragging and dropping a .env looks like:

### Environments

In most cases, environment variables belong to specific environments: development, staging, testing, and production. You can input environment variables for each environment that your project uses.

![project environment](../../images/project-environment.png)

### Personal overrides

Every environment variable value can be overridden with a custom value.

- An overridden value can only be read and accessed by the user that overrode the original shared value.
- A (default) shared value can be read and accessed by other users in a project.

You can turn overrides on/off by toggling the override/branch icon:

### Search

You can search for any environment variable by its key.

![project search](../../images/project-search.png)

### Hide/Un-hide

You can hide or un-hide the values of your environment variables. By default, the values are hidden for your privacy.

### Download as .env

You can download your environment variables back in a .env file.
