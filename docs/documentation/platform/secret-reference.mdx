You can use the interpolation syntax to reference a secret in the same environment, another folder, or another environment
The interpolation syntax is a way of referencing a secret by using a special placeholder. The placeholder is the name of the secret, followed by the environment or folder name, separated by a colon. 

For example, to reference a secret named mysecret in the same environment, you would use the placeholder ${mysecret}.

While for another environment like `test` would be ${test.mysecret}

Some more examples of referencing  are 

| Syntax                | Environment | Folder       | Secret Key |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| ${KEY1}               | same env    | ssame folder | KEY1       |
| ${dev.KEY2}           | dev         | /            | KEY2       |
| ${test.frontend.KEY2} | test        | /frontend    | KEY2       |

# Permission system for reference

When you use the infisical CLI to log in, the permission system will work the same way as your user permissions. 
This means that if you have permission to access other environments, your references to those environments will be resolved.

When using the Infisical CLI with a service token, the service token must have permissions to the referenced environment and folder path.
