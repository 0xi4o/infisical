This guide demonstrates how to manage secrets for your Node stack from local development to production. It uses:

- Infisical (you can use [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com) or a [self-hosted instance of Infisical](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/overview)) to store your secrets.
- The [infisical-node](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-node) client SDK to fetch secrets back to your Node application on demand.
