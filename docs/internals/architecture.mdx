Infisical is a complex system with many parts to it. This page aims to help you build a mental model of the system architecture including how core flows are implemented.

## Components

### Infisical API

The Infisical API (sometimes referred to as the **backend**) contains the core platform logic.

### Storage backend

Infisical relies on a storage backend to store data including users and secrets.

Currently, the only supported storage backend is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) but we plan to add support for other options including PostgreSQL in Q1 2024.

### Redis

Infisical uses Redis to enable more complex workflows including a queuing system to manage long running asynchronous tasks, cron jobs, as well as reliable cache for frequently used resources.

### Infisical Web UI

The Web UI is the browser-based portal that connects to the Infisical API.

### Infisical clients

Clients are any application or infrastructure that connecting to the Infisical API using one of the below methods:
- Public API: Making API requests directly to the Infisical API.
- Client SDK: A platform-specific library with method abstractions for working with secrets. Currently, there are two official SDKs: [Node SDK](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-node) and [Python SDK](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-python).
- CLI: A terminal-based interface for interacting with the Infisical API.
- Kubernetes Operator: This operator retrieves secrets from Infisical and securely stores them in a designated cluster; it uses an InfisicalSecret resource to dictate authentication and storage procedures. 

## Flows

### Signup

When a user signs up for an account with Infisical using email/password, they must verify their email by correctly entering the 6-digit OTP code sent to their email.
After this procedure, a public-private k

### Login
