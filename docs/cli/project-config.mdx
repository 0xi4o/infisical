To link your local project on your machine with an Infisical project, we suggest using the infisical init CLI command. This will generate a `.infisical.json` file in the root directory of your project.

The `.infisical.json` file specifies various parameters, such as the Infisical project to retrieve secrets from, along with other configuration options. Furthermore, you can define additional properties in the file to further tailor your local development experience.

## Set Infisical environment based on GitHub branch 
When fetching your secrets from Infisical, you can switch between environments by using the `--env` flag. However, in certain cases, you may prefer the environment to be automatically mapped based on the current GitHub branch you are working on. 
To achieve this, simply add the `gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping` property to your configuration file, as shown below.

```json .infisical.json
{
  "workspaceId": "63ee5410a45f7a1ed39ba118",
  "gitBranchToEnvironmentMapping": {
    "branchName": "dev",
    "anotherBranchName": "staging"
  }
}
```

### How it works
After configuring this property, every time you use the CLI with the specified configuration file, it will automatically verify if there is a corresponding environment mapping for the current Github branch you are on.
If it exists, the CLI will use that environment to retrieve secrets. You can override this behavior by explicitly using the `--env` flag while interacting with the CLI.
