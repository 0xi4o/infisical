Point-in-time (PIT) recovery allows environment variables to be rolled back to any point in time. It's powered by snapshots that get captured after mutations to environment variables.

## Commits

Similar to Git, a commit in Infisical is a snapshot of your project's secrets at a specific point in time. You can browse and view your project's snapshots via the "Point-in-Time Recovery" sidebar.
