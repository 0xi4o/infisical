title: "Infisical Token"
---

An Infisical Token is needed to authenticate the CLI when there isn't an easy way to input your login credentials.

It's useful for the [Docker](/integrations/platforms/docker) and [Docker Compose](/integrations/platforms/docker-compose) integrations.

It's possible to generate the token in the settings of a project.

<Note>
  The token grants read-only access to a particular environment and project for
  a specified amount of time.
