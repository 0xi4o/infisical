Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

## Navigate to your project's integrations tab

![integrations](../../images/integrations.png)

## Authorize Infisical for GitHub

Press on the GitHub tile and grant Infisical access to your GitHub account (repo privileges only).

![integrations github authorization](../../images/integrations-github-auth.png)

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant Infisical access to your project's environment variables.
  Although this step breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which GitHub repo and press start integration to start syncing secrets to the repo.
