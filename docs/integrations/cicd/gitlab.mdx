To integrate Infisical secrets into your Gitlab CI/CD setup, three steps are required.

## Generate service token 
To expose Infisical secrets in Gitlab CI/CD, you must generate a service token for the specific project and environment in Infisical. For instructions on how to generate a service token, refer to [this page](../../getting-started/dashboard/token)

## Set Infisical service token in Gitlab 
To provide Infisical CLI with the service token generated in the previous step, go to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables** in Gitlab and create a new **INFISICAL_TOKEN** variable. Enter the generated service token as its value.

## Configure Infisical in your pipeline 
Edit your .gitlab-ci.yml to include the installation of the Infisical CLI. This will allow you to use the CLI for fetching and injecting secrets into any script or command within your Gitlab CI/CD process.

#### Example
```yaml 
image: ubuntu

stages:       
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:     
  stage: build
  script:
    - apt update && apt install -y curl
    - curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/infisical-cli/setup.deb.sh' | bash
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y infisical
    - infisical run -- npm run build

```
