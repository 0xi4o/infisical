title: "Next.js"

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Infisical for your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app

```bash
# move to your Next.js app
cd /path/to/project

# initialize infisical
infisical init
```

## Modify the start script in your `package.json`

```json
...
"scripts": {
    "dev": "infisical run -- next dev",
    "build": "infisical run -- next build",
    "start": "infisical run -- next start"
}
...
```

## Start your server with environment variables injected

```bash
npm run build && npm run start

# or start development server

npm run dev
```

<Note>
  Note that for environment variables to be exposed to the client, you'll have
  to prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Read more about that
  [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).
