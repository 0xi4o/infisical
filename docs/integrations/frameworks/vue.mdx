Prerequisite: [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Infisical for your [Vue](https://vuejs.org) app

```bash
# move to your Vue app
cd /path/to/project

# initialize infisical
infisical init
```

## Modify the start script in your `package.json`

```json
...
"scripts": {
    "serve": "infisical run -- vue-cli-service serve",
    "build": "infisical run -- vue-cli-service build",
    "lint": "infisical run -- vue-cli-service lint"
}
...
```

## Start your development server with environment variables injected

```bash
npm run serve
```

<Note>
  Note that for environment variables to be exposed to the client, you'll have
  to prefix them with `VUE_APP` Read more about that
  [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html).
