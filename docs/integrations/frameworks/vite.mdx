title: "Vite"
---

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
- [Install the CLI](/cli/overview)

## Initialize Infisical for your [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) app

```bash
# move to your Vite app
cd /path/to/project

# initialize infisical
infisical init
```

## Modify the start script in your `package.json`

```json
...
"scripts": {
    "dev": "infisical run -- vite",
    "build": "infisical run -- vite build",
    "preview": "infisical run -- vite preview"
}
...
```

## Start your development server with environment variables injected

```bash
npm run dev
```

<Note>
  Note that for environment variables to be exposed to the client, you'll have
  to prefix them with `VITE_` and export them from the `vite.config.js` file.
  Read more about that [here](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) and
  [here](https://main.vitejs.dev/config).
