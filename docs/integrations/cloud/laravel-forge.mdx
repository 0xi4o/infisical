Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)

## Navigate to your project's integrations tab

Obtain a Laravel Forge access token in API Tokens

![integrations laravel forge dashboard](../../images/null)
![integrations laravel forge api tokens](../../images/null)

Obtain a Laravel Forge server id in Servers

![integrations laravel forge server](../../images/null)
![integrations laravel forge server id](../../images/null)

Press on the Laravel Forge tile and input your Laravel Forge access token and server id to grant Infisical access to your Laravel Forge account.

<Info>
  If this is your project's first cloud integration, then you'll have to grant
  Infisical access to your project's environment variables. Although this step
  breaks E2EE, it's necessary for Infisical to sync the environment variables to
  the cloud platform.
</Info>

## Start integration

Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to which Laravel Forge site and press create integration to start syncing secrets to Laravel Forge.
