<Warning>
  Infisical's REST API is currently unavailable and scheduled to go live on Jan

</Warning>

Infisical's REST API provides users an alternative way to programmatically access and manage
secrets via HTTPS requests. This can be useful for automating tasks, such as
rotating credentials, or for integrating secret management into a larger system.

With the REST API, users can create, read, update, and delete secrets, as well as manage access control, query audit logs, and more.

## Concepts

Using Infisical's API to manage secrets requires a basic understanding of the system and its underlying cryptography detailed [here](/security/overview).

- Each user has a public/private key pair that is stored with the platform; private keys are encrypted locally by the user's password before being sent off to the server during the account signup process.
- Each (encrypted) secret belongs to a project and environment.
- Each project has an (encrypted) project key used to encrypt the secrets within that project; Infisical stores copies of the project key, for each member of that project, encrypted under each member's public key.
- Secrets are encrypted symmetrically by your copy of the project key belonging to the project containing.
- Infisical uses AES256-GCM and [TweetNaCl.js](https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/) for symmetric and asymmetric encryption/decryption operations.

<Info>
  Infisical's system ensures greater security such that secrets are
  encrypted/decrypted on the client-side but requires users to properly
  implement cryptographic operations to maintain end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
