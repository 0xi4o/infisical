title: "Delete secrets"
---

In this example, we demonstrate how to delete secrets

Prerequisites:

- Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com)
- Grasp a basic understanding of the system and its underlying cryptography [here](/api-reference/overview/introduction).

## Example

```js
const deleteSecrets = async () => {
  const API_KEY = "your_api_key";
  const SECRET_ID = "ID"; // ID of secret to delete

  // 6. Send ID(s) of secret(s) to delete to the Infisical API
  await axios.delete(
    `https://api.infisical.com/api/v2/secrets`,
    {
      secretIds: SECRET_ID,
    },
    {
      headers: {
        "X-API-KEY": API_KEY,
      },
    }
  );
};

deleteSecrets();
```
