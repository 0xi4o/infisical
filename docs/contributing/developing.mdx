## Clone the repo

```bash
# change location to the path you want Infisical to be installed
cd ~

# clone the repo and cd to Infisical dir
git clone https://github.com/Infisical/infisical
cd infisical
```

## Set up environment variables

Start by creating a .env file at the root of the Infisical directory. It's best to start with the provided [`.env.example`](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical/blob/main/.env.example) template containing the necessary envars to fill out your .env file â€” you only have to modify the SMTP parameters.

<Warning>
    The pre-populated environment variable values in the `.env.example` file are meant to be used in development only.
    You'll want to fill in your own values in production, especially concerning encryption keys, secrets, and SMTP parameters.
</Warning>

Refer to the [environment variable list](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/envars) for guidance on each envar.

### Helpful tips for developing with Infisical:

<Tip>
Use the `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, JWT-secret envars, `MONGO_URL`, `MONGO_USERNAME`, `MONGO_PASSWORD` provided in the `.env.example` file.

If setting your own values: 

- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` should be a [32-byte random hex](https://www.browserling.com/tools/random-hex)
- `MONGO_URL` should take the form: `mongodb://[MONGO_USERNAME]:[MONGO_PASSWORD]@mongo:27017/?authSource=admin`.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Bring and configure your own SMTP server by following our [email configuration guide](https://infisical.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration/email) (we recommend using either SendGrid or Mailgun).

Alternatively, you can use the provided development (Mailhog) SMTP server to send and browse emails sent by the backend on http://localhost:8025; to use this option, set the following `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` below.
</Tip>

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp-server
SMTP_PORT=1025
SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS=team@infisical.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Infisical
SMTP_USERNAME=team@infisical.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=
```

<Warning>
    If using Mailhog, make sure to leave the `SMTP_PASSWORD` blank so the backend can connect to MailHog.
</Warning>

## Docker for development

```bash
# build and start the services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build --force-recreate
```

Then browse http://localhost:8080

```bash
# To stop environment use Control+C (on Mac) CTRL+C (on Win) or
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
# start services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
