- **Navigate Multiple Environments** per project (e.g. development, staging, production, etc.)
- **Personal/Shared** scoping for environment variables
- **[Integrations](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/heroku)** with CI/CD and production infrastructure (Heroku available, more coming soon)
- üîú **1-Click Deploy** to Digital Ocean and Heroku

And more.

## Get started

To quickly get started, visit our [get started guide](https://infisical.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).

## What's cool about this?

Infisical is simple, E2EE, and (soon to be) complete.

According to a [report](https://www.ekransystem.com/en/blog/secrets-management) in 2019, only 10% of organizations use secret management solutions despite all using digital secrets to some extent.

We're on a mission to make secret management more accessible to everyone ‚Äî that means building for developers, not just security teams.

If you care about efficiency and security, then Infisical is right for you.

## Status

- [x] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [infisical.com](https://infisical.com) but go easy on us, there are kinks and we're just getting started.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready.

We're currently in Public Alpha.

## Integrations

We're currently setting the foundation and building integrations so secrets can be synced everywhere. Any help is welcome! :)

- [x] [Docker](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/docker)
- [x] [Docker Compose](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/docker-compose)
- [x] [Heroku](https://infisical.com/docs/integrations/heroku)
- [ ] Vercel
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [ ] AWS
- [ ] GCP
- [ ] Azure
- [ ] Digital Ocean
- [ ] GitLab
- [ ] CircleCI

## Open-source vs. paid

This repo is entirely MIT licensed, with the exception of the `ee` directory which will contain premium enterprise features requring a Infisical license in the future. We're currently focused on developing non-enterprise offerings first that should suit most use-cases.
